# The Importance of "Mastery Learning"

## The Inefficiencies of the Modern Education System

Have you ever wondered why our education system seems to fall short despite the significant investment of time and resources? From K-12 to college and beyond, we dedicate a substantial portion of our lives to education. However, the outcomes often leave much to be desired.

Think back to all the lectures you've attended, only to forget a majority of the information shortly after. Or the times when you felt completely lost in a class because you didn't grasp a foundational concept. And what about questioning the relevance of certain subjects to your life?

If you're anything like me, the answer to all these questions is "too many times."

## The Importance of Education

Education plays a vital role in society. The knowledge we acquire opens doors of opportunity and shapes the decisions we make. Without a well-educated population, societies risk the same tragic fate seen during the time of the Khmer Rouge. That's why it's crucial to delve into the reasons behind the inefficiencies in our education system and explore potential solutions.

## Uncovering the Root Causes

When it comes to the inefficiency of our education system, there are several factors at play. We could point fingers at teachers for not effectively connecting with their students, or blame the government for inadequate teacher compensation. The misallocation of funds within schools, lack of parental enforcement of study habits, and students' own lack of focus could also be seen as contributing factors.

However, placing blame on any single party doesn't provide a comprehensive answer. Instead, it's essential to understand that our current system developed naturally. With one teacher responsible for a class of numerous students, it becomes impossible to cater to the unique needs of each individual. Students who struggle to grasp a concept often get left behind. Those with different learning styles or preferences may also find themselves at a disadvantage. Additionally, students with learning disabilities face unique challenges.

Teachers do their best to adapt and teach to the masses, but inevitably some students end up falling behind. This issue, commonly referred to as the "glove" or "one-size-fits-all" problem within education circles, is a critical concern.

## The Lack of Solutions

While we've recognized the problem of uniform teaching and its limitations, we have yet to see adequate solutions. Pressed to cover the curriculum and ensure good performance on exams, teachers often resort to teaching to the test. This approach prioritizes exams rather than true comprehension and fails to address the individual needs of students. It also overlooks the real-world skills that students should be acquiring and leaves many struggling to keep up.

## Introducing Mastery Learning

Fortunately, there is an alternative approach that emphasizes real-world skills and personalized instruction: Mastery learning. This innovative concept encourages deep and thorough understanding of each topic before progressing to the next.

Every student learns at their own pace. Teaching uniformly hampers individual progress and results. Students who quickly grasp a concept should be allowed to move forward, while those who struggle receive additional support to catch up. This personalized approach tailors education to meet the needs of each student and prioritizes mastery over superficial marks.

## Overcoming Logistical Challenges

The reason this approach has not been widely implemented is due to logistical constraints. It is simply not feasible for a single teacher to personalize instruction for a class with a large number of unique students. This challenge has persisted throughout history and continues to be relevant today.

However, thanks to modern technology, we now have the potential to revolutionize the education system. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to significantly improve the learning experience. While some educators may initially feel apprehensive about AI replacing their role or introducing confusion, the truth is that AI can complement traditional teaching methods. It can serve as an individual tutor, helping students learn concepts at their own optimal pace, and delivering personalized instruction.

The goal is to level the playing field and ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed.

## Empowering Education with AI

Research and development initiatives, like OpenClass, are focused on harnessing the potential of AI to transform education. The incorporation of AI technology allows for a more personalized and effective approach to learning. By supplementing traditional teaching methods, AI can bridge the gap between uniform instruction and individualized needs.

Let's embrace the possibilities presented by AI and strive towards an education system that fosters mastery, caters to unique learning styles, and prepares students for real-world success.
